## Methods

### Sampling
*Question*: Should I use the terminology asexual and sexual or unisexual and bisexual? I realized I've been using asexual and sexual without thinking too hard about it. Just because there's a unisexual population, it doesn't mean they're not at least facultatively parthenogenic, right?  


A total of six Phasmid species were sampled from across New Zealand (Table). We selected species that contain multiple asexual and sexual populations. *Need sampling details*.

### Environmental data

### Marginality
Niche marginality is the magnitude which the center of species' Hutchinsonian niche differs from available environmental conditions (Hirzel et al. 2002). We estimated the marginality of each species-reproductive mode combination using the adehabitatHS v0.3.14 package in R v3.6.0 (adehabitat CITE, R CITE). Statistical significance was assessed using a permutation-based approach, implemented in the R package adehabitatHS v0.3.14 *(Elaborate?)*. We obtained 19 bioclimatic variables from the CHELSA database v1.2 to summarize current climatic conditions (Karger et al. 2017). These variables are derived from the ERA-Interim climatic analysis and capture broad-scale temperature and precipitation patterns. The variables were scaled at 1 km resolution. We sampled all environment from within a 50 km buffer placed around a minimum convex hull of each species' sampling range to represent the available background environment. 

### Stability
To capture historical climate dynamics, we obtained climate data from seven additional time periods: the late-Holocene (4.2-0.3 kya), the mid-Holocene (8.326-4.2 kya), the early-Holocene (11.7-8.326 kya), the Younger Dryas Stadial (12.9-11.7 kya), the Bølling-Allerød (14.7-12.9 kya), the Heinrich Stadial 1 (17.0-14.7 kya), and the Last Glacial Maximum (~21 kya). All variables were downloaded from the Paleoclim database (Brown cite). All variables except the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) were derived from Fordham et al. (2017). The LGM data were derived from the CHELSA v1.2 database, which uses the PMIP3 circulation model (Karger et al. 2017). All variables were scaled to 5 km resolution, and current climate was downscaled to match the resolution of the other variables. We estimated climate stability since the LGM using the average annual temperature and average annual precipitation variables. We used the climateStability v0.1.1 R package (Owens and Guralnick 2019) to calculate stability across time periods. Briefly, the method calculates the stability of a climate variable as inverse of the mean standard deviation between time slices over time elapsed (Owens and Guralnick 2019). In addition to temperature and precipitation stability, we estimated overall climate stability as the product of the two stability values. We then extracted stability values for each species-reproductive mode combination, where a stability value was recovered for each individual locality. To assess statistical differences in occupied stability between reproductive modes, we conducted Welch's t-tests (CITE) for each species and stability metric.

### Seasonality

## Results

### Marginality
* Sexual individuals occupied more marginal habitat than asexual individuals for all species
* p-values to come

### Stability
* Asexual individuals occupy siginficantly more stable climate space than sexual individuals in three species- *Asteliaphasma jucundum*, *Clitarchus hookeri*, and *Tectarchus ovobessus*. In *A. jucundum* and *C. hookeri*, this is in all three metrics. In *T. ovobessus*, this is for temperature.
* Sexual individuals occupy significantly more stable climate space than asexual individuals in *Argosarchus horridus* according to all three metrics 
* See table for significant results

### Marginality scores
Caption: Marginality estimates for each species-reproductive mode combination. In all cases, sexual individuals occupy more marginal environmental space than asexual individuals. Ecological niche factor analysis was performed to determine if a reproductive mode occupies more marginal environmental space than the background environment of the entire species. Statistical significance is indicated by asterisks, where \* indicates *p* < 0.05 and \*\* indicates *p* < 0.01.

Note: going to include asterisks to indicate statistical significance or mention in the caption and reference the  table if many values are significant. Will insert significance asterisks outside of R.

### Stability
*Note: below the statistics are stability maps to put these results into context*


Caption: Distribution of environmental stability since the last glacial maximum (LGM) for each species-reproductive mode combination. Stability was estimated for average annual temperature, average annual precipitation, and overall stability, which is temperature multiplied by precipitation. Time periods for the  Statistical significance is indicated by asterisks, where \* indicates *p* < 0.05 and \*\* indicates *p* < 0.01.

Note: I'm putting asterisks in outside of R. The top row are all significantly different across metrics (temp, precip, overall). T. ovobessus is significantly different for temperature.

### Environmental space
Should I make a plot of environmental PCA space to illustrate marginality further? Is it superfluous?

Idea 1: Just use the hex plot with species env. space scatterplot on top that I've already made. Might choose a different way to represent density of background environmental space.

Idea 2: contour plot in PC space (the dimension reduction ENFA outputs or PCA): unique contours for each reproductive mode and background e-space.
